# KIT Timesheets

This repository contains tools to make filling out KIT time sheets easier. It is
inspired by the [SDQ TimeSheetGenerator][tsg] and a friend's very useful wrapper
website that spits out PDFs directly.

## Typst template

The centerpiece of the repository is a [typst][typst] template that generates
and validates time sheets. It aims to mirror the look of the official form as
closely as possible. For usage information, see [its docs][tdocs].
